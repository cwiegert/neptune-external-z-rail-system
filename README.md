# Neptune 4 Pro ‚Äì Z Axis Linear Rail Mounting System

This mod was inspired by the limitations and challenges imposed on Neptune printers by the TBStrong z rail kit.   Why do you need z rails at all?   Well, you don't, but I have them, and I never have to worry about aligning pom wheels, or any kind of z banding.   If you are here, you are interested in putting rails on the z axis, becuase you have probably already put the y axis rails and perhaps the x axis upgrade <link here for that git repo address>.    

This design incorporates rails on the outside of the Gantry.   Unlike the Tbstrong upgrade, this change will eliminate the interference with x axis movement and any cable chain system you might want to install.   The inside the gantry limits any well designed chain link system, as the adaptor off the tool head typically hits the rail on both gantry posts.

## üì¶ Some basics to start wtih

- MGN12H rails are used, with the larger H carriages.

- Suggest to use light load Z rails, especially if you have a Beacon H or any other eddy probe. Any heavier preload will cause Z axis noise and cause the eddy to trigger early.

- There are prerequisites, that you may want to consider. Initial release is designed to work with the SilencedFrost X axis rail upgrade and the Layer.Shifted double shear X motor upgrade.

- While changing the mount, I upgraded to a 48mm motor, over the 39mm on the stock Neptune 4 Pro. The standard motor will work - but I had an extra, so why not.

- All files have included in this repo which were sourced from other mods, have been modified to work for this kit.   Including the printhead hanger for the x axis rail modification.   Because the end stop switch is flipped from stock, a finger on top of the rail was required for in this mod

- The current offset on the x axis endstop switch is designed to fit the stock position, and the finger added to the x axis printhead will trigger a stock 0 point.

- **finish writing the pre-reqs here... make sure to put the basics up top**

## üß∞ Tools Required

- Linear rail: **MGN12H** or similar (confirmed fit recommended)
- M3/M4 hardware for mounting (bolts, nuts, washers)
- Optional: Printed spacers or shims (included)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Overview

1. **Print the STL files** using your Neptune 4 Pro or another 3D printer.
2. **Disassemble** the original Z-axis lead screw carriage if necessary.
3. **Mount the linear rail** to the Z gantry using provided mounting holes and printed brackets.
4. **Attach the carriage** to the linear rail block using the printed or CNC‚Äôd mount.
5. **Reassemble and test movement** using manual motion or G-code commands.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure the linear rail is **parallel to the Z extrusion** and secured tightly for best performance.

## üìå Compatibility
