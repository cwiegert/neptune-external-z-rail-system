# Neptune 4 Pro – Z Axis Linear Rail Mounting System

This repository contains **STEP** and **STL** files for a custom Z-axis linear rail mounting system designed specifically for the **Elegoo Neptune 4 Pro** 3D printer.

## 📦 Contents

The following files are included in this repo:

- `STEP/` – 3D CAD files for modification or inspection in parametric design tools (e.g., Fusion 360, FreeCAD, SolidWorks)
- `STL/` – Mesh files ready for 3D printing
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 🧰 Tools Required

- Linear rail: **MGN12H** or similar (confirmed fit recommended)
- M3/M4 hardware for mounting (bolts, nuts, washers)
- Optional: Printed spacers or shims (included)

## 🛠️ Installation Overview

1. **Print the STL files** using your Neptune 4 Pro or another 3D printer.
2. **Disassemble** the original Z-axis lead screw carriage if necessary.
3. **Mount the linear rail** to the Z gantry using provided mounting holes and printed brackets.
4. **Attach the carriage** to the linear rail block using the printed or CNC’d mount.
5. **Reassemble and test movement** using manual motion or G-code commands.

> ⚠️ Ensure the linear rail is **parallel to the Z extrusion** and secured tightly for best performance.

## 📌 Compatibility

- **Printer:** Elegoo Neptune 4 Pro
- **Rail type:** MGN12H (or similar) with 300mm recommended length
- **Clearances:** Designed to maintain compatibility with stock frame dimensions

## 🧪 Notes

- Files are designed with **tight tolerances** to minimize backlash.
- STEP files are included so you can modify dimensions or hole patterns as needed.
- It is recommended to use **thread locker** on metal-to-metal fasteners.
